# Help me build this feature and win a bounty of $50

An Android application that enables simultaneous audio playback from multiple apps with individual volume control.

## Bounty: $50

**Objective:**  
Develop a feature that allows playing audio from multiple apps simultaneously (e.g., Spotify + YouTube + Google Drive) with individual volume sliders for each app.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Simultaneous Audio Playback:**
   - When enabled, audio from multiple apps should play simultaneously
   - Opening a new app with audio shouldn't stop previous app's audio
   - Should work with at least 3 different media apps (Spotify, YouTube, Google Drive, etc.)

2. **Volume Control:**
   - UI with sliders to control volume of each playing app
   - Should dynamically detect active audio sessions
   - Volume changes should be applied in real-time

3. **Compatibility:**
   - Must work without root (Shizuku is acceptable)
   - Should work on Android 10+ (target API 34)

### Technical Constraints
- Kotlin implementation preferred
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- No memory leaks or performance issues

### Submission Requirements
1. Working implementation in a GitHub repository
2. Pull request to this repository (if building upon existing code)
3. Demonstration video showing:
   - Starting multiple media apps
   - All audio playing simultaneously
   - Adjusting individual volumes
   - Functionality persists when switching between apps

## Current Implementation

The existing code provides:
- Shizuku integration
- Basic audio focus management
- Service infrastructure
- Permission handling

### Known Issues
- Audio focus is immediately lost when other apps play sound
- No actual multi-audio functionality implemented yet
- No volume control UI

## Building Upon Existing Code

You may:
1. Extend the current implementation, or
2. Start a new project with better architecture

Key files:
- `MainActivity.kt` - UI and permission handling
- `AudioControlService.kt` - Background service for audio control
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Permission declarations

## Evaluation Criteria

The bounty will be awarded for:
1. Fully functional simultaneous audio playback
2. Working volume control UI
3. Clean, well-documented code
4. Demonstration video proving functionality

## How to Claim the Bounty

1. Fork this repository
2. Implement the feature
3. Create a pull request with:
   - Your implementation
   - Updated README documenting your changes
   - Link to demonstration video

The first complete, working implementation meeting all requirements will receive the $50 bounty via PayPal or other agreed payment method.
